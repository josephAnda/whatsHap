# whatsHap
January 9, 2017 --Version 1.1--

This is the first officially documented version of the whatshap website.  The following issues are intended to guide the
future development of this page.  

Major bugs/design flaws to fix:
[  ]  The breaking of user signup upon live hosting (i.e. not via github pages)
[  ]  The client-side accessibility of email script (limit this via encryption)
[  ]  Consistent formatting for all mobile and desktop platforms
[  ]  Consistent method for referencing information of the visual elements 
[  ]  Use of a testing framework
[  ]  Strict definition of modules/components (currently lacking in part due to the sipmlicity of the current implementation)
